## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?

What was most challenging was making sure I was reading in the correct files, but once I figured out the try/catch statements, it was easier. What was most interesting was the ability to use binary like this to decode messages as well as encode. I already knew how to convert binary into decimal and use that to find a character using ACSII by hand, but using a program is much faster. What I learned that I might use again is definitely the recursive way of writing a tree, that was a lot more efficient than iteratively that I used for the last assignment, in my opinion. I liked this assignment a lot, it was super fun
